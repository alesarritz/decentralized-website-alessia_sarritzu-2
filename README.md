### **📖 How It Works**
1. **Every time a change is pushed** to this repository, GitHub Actions automatically uploads the updated website to IPFS.
2. **A new CID is generated** for each deployment, as IPFS uses content-addressing.
3. The latest CID is logged in the **GitHub Actions logs** after deployment.

### **🚀 Deployment Workflow**
- The deployment process is fully **automated** using GitHub Actions.
- The website is uploaded to **Pinata**, a decentralized IPFS pinning service.
- The latest **CID can be retrieved from GitHub Actions logs**.
